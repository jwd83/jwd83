### Hi there 👋

🔭 I'm Jared De Blander, founder of [Ayrscott, LLC](https://ayrscott.com/)

🌱 I’m currently learning Deno, PhaserJS & DigitalOcean's App Platform

💬 Feel free to ask me anything about  🏎️ motorsports or 🐱‍💻 software + firmware development.

I worked as employee #3 for Powertrain Control Solutions and designed their PC software for use with their automatic transmission controller (TCU), XFC Fuel Controller and D200 Dash Logger and various internal tools as my first job after graduating highschool in '01.  I spent nearly two decades in that industry before starting Ayrscott, LLC from my growing freelancing work following my resignation from the industry in '19.

😄 Pronouns: he/him

⚡ Fun fact: Back in the late '90s I came in 251st place in hackerslab.org's worldwide hacking competition!
