# üìñ A bit about myself...

üå± I‚Äôm currently interested in learning more about FPGAs & CPU design in [Verilog](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Special:VlgStats/5CBCEE65CFD17EBB), Raylib, PyGame, [combinational and sequential](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Computer-Electronics-Albert-Malvino/dp/0028005945) [logic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444480/Turing_Complete/) and [Artificial Intelligence](https://chat.openai.com/).

I've been programming since childhood, once attending a QBASIC focused summer camp in the early 1990's. I got hooked and quickly moved onto C++, Visual Basic, HTML and making a host of AOL "hacking" tools leading to my parent's account getting a ban for a chat utility I worked on that evaded their message rate timeout system by the end of my sophmore year of high school.

In the late 1990's during my junior year of high school I worked for a company called [Envista](https://web.archive.org/web/19991011020250/http://envista.com/envista/index.html) that did a mix of HTML and ColdFusion development for a number of fiancial industry clients including [Burke & Herbert Bank](https://www.burkeandherbertbank.com) and [The Clinton Group, Inc](https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.the_clinton_group_inc.33ea3499ac99219ffe428ac284ae43f0.html).

After graduating high school in the post dot-com bubble I went on to work as employee #3 for [Powertrain Control Solutions](https://www.powertraincontrolsolutions.com/) and designed their PC software for use with their [automatic transmission controller (TCU)](https://www.powertraincontrolsolutions.com/Performance_Aftermarket/Products/Transmission_Products/TCM2000_Transmission_Controller/), XFC Fuel Controller, [D200 Dashlogger](https://www.powertraincontrolsolutions.com/Performance_Aftermarket//Products/Displays/D200_Dashlogger/) and various internal tools. I went on to spend nearly two decades in that industry performing a range of IT and programming tasks ranging from eCommerce to accounting automation along with countless other responsbilities before moving on to found [Ayrscott, LLC](https://ayrscott.com/) in 2021 from my growing freelancing projects amidst the height of the COVID pandemic.

‚ö° Fun fact: Back in the late '90s I came in 251st place in hackerslab.org's worldwide hacking competition! ü•∑
