### Hi there 


I'm **Jared De Blander**, founder of [Ayrscott, LLC](https://ayrscott.com/)

🌱 I’m currently learning Deno, PhaserJS & DigitalOcean's App Platform

💬 Feel free to ask me anything about motorsports 🏎️ or software + firmware development. 💻

🤓 I worked as employee #3 for Powertrain Control Solutions and designed their PC software for use with their automatic transmission controller (TCU), XFC Fuel Controller and D200 Dash Logger and various internal tools as my first job after graduating highschool in '01.  I went on to spend nearly two decades in that industry performing a range of IT and programming tasks from eCommerce and dropshipping to accounting and automation along with countless other responsbilities before moving on to start Ayrscott, LLC from my growing freelancing work.

These days I can found behounnd my desk at home working on projects for myself or clients while listening to music and receiving feedback from my ~~junior developer~~ pupper Peach.

😄 Pronouns: he/him

⚡ Fun fact: Back in the late '90s I came in 251st place in hackerslab.org's worldwide hacking competition! 🥷
